# Making the trigram and hexagram systems

## Basic description
Yijing divination is based on the dynamics of yin and yang and balances and imbalances in their different symbolisms. Yin and yang are represented by a broken and solid line, respectively. These lines are combined into **trigrams**, a collection of three lines, each broken or solid; there are eight possible trigram variants. These trigrams can be combined into **hexagrams**, a collection of two trigrams, to form a total of 64 possible hexagrams.

## Why?
I am atheist (if pushed, agnostic) and science-oriented. I do not believe in the claimed powers of divination to predict the future or describe current states of affairs. I do believe in Yijing's power to *influence* our thoughts and beliefs. It is a beautifully constructed system of symbols that -- like horoscopes, dream-reading, or tarot -- one can draw *meaning* and *suggestion* from, and this is where its utility arises.
